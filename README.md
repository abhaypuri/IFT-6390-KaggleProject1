# IFT-6390-KaggleProject1

#### This code repo was build as a part of the kaggle competition 1 Classification of extreme weather events for IFT 6390 Machine Learning course. 
#### The goal of this project is to implement and train several classification algorithms. In this paper, I present a comparative study of different machine learning supervised classification techniques Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests, XGBoost and Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM).
