# IFT-6390-KaggleProject1

This code repo was build as a part of the kaggle competition 1 Classification of extreme weather events for IFT 6390 Machine Learning course. The goal of this project is to implement and train several classification algorithms. In this paper, I present a comparative study of different machine learning supervised classification techniques Logistic Regression from scratch, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests, XGBoost and Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM). 

The code kaggle_competition_MLR_scratch.ipynb requires numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries to run.

The train data(train.csv) and test data(test.csv) must be uploaded in the Google drive because I used Google Colaboratory for the entire project and it's present under Data folder.

After this you can run this Jupyter notebook.

A submission.csv file would be generated that can be uploaded to the Kaggle Competition.
